# Premiere-Pro-Centering-Cropped-Media-Tool
Trying to center cropped media in Premiere Pro is quite annoying, this tool simplifies things

## Info
This was just a little website I set up randomly to save me time centering cropped media in Adobe Premiere Pro. I'm not great with HTML/JS/CSS so I'm sure a lot could be better, but it works! Not sure if this will be useufl to anyone else, but who knows.

This was based on [Azlan Iqbal's medium post](https://medium.com/@azlaniqbal/centering-cropped-images-or-video-using-adobe-premiere-pro-c9d24c71cb05), this website just automates having to calculate everything manually.
